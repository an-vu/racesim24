# Approach for player setup

## Phase 1: Build the visual layout and input fields in setup.html (no back-end changes needed yet).

## Phase 2: Plan data flow and set up a form submission that passes data to the back end.

## Phase 3: Add basic backend logic in routes.py to handle and store player info, then update home.html to display this data.


# Planned Universal Classes and Their Placement

## Headers & Subheaders:
.main-title (for primary headers, like page titles): Replace inline header styles in setup.html, home.html, and base.html.
.sub-title (for subtitles): Use in areas like the update message in home.html and player titles in setup.html.

## Containers:
.content: Central container that centers content, used across pages. Ensures vertical and horizontal alignment.
.box: Core styling for any container (background color, padding, border radius, shadow). Use for player setup boxes, standings, and control centers.
.box-large and .box-small can be subclasses of .box for resizing.
.centered-container: Apply in base.html and .content divs to centralize content across the entire viewport.

## Buttons:
.button: Base button style for uniform padding, border-radius.
.button-primary, .button-danger for different actions (e.g., start race, reset).
Replace inline button styles for the "Start Race" and pit/reset buttons in home.html and setup.html.

## Profile Picture Placeholder:
.profile-picture: Standardize for the circular image placeholder. This ensures itâ€™s easy to customize if you change image sizes or colors across themes.

## Table:
.standings-table: For tables in home.html, using .standings-table ensures a consistent look.
Add header and cell styles for alignment, border-bottom, padding, etc., so each page with tables will follow the same setup.

## Input Fields:
.input-field: Standardize for text and number input styling in setup.html. It replaces the inline input styles with a class for consistent padding, border, and radius.
